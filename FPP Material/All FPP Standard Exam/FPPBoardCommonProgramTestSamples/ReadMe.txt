To Pass in the FPP Course, You should get pass in the Common programming test as well as minumum 83 in my class.

Programing test contains two programs. You are not going to write complete programs. You have some implemented classes, just need to do the required part.

1. Polymorphism
2. Data Structure

Along this ReadMe.txt file, you have FPP Board Common Program Test Samples folder which contains several past Program Test conducted for previous batches with solution.

Also some sample programs for data structure part from our demo code I have included in this folder. Refer your homework solutions also.

For the Polymorphism concept refer the sample code and solution from the Past test as well as Homework.

Note : Examples in this folders are just samples. If you have a good practice in it, you can able to write any programs under these concepts.

Comparator

Folder Reference : FPP Board Common Program Test Samples\DataStructure\Comparator also refer Demo code and your homework

You should able to implements Comparable and Comparator with the help of Collections.sort()

Some times Comparator/Comparable consist with equals() based on the problem requirements.

User Implementation of Data Structure : ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack and Queue. 

Able to know how to use HashTable, ArrayList and Arrays for your own class(like Employee, Address class etc.,) to insert, accessing values based on some criteria,remove duplicates by using API.

Should be familiar with overriding of Object methods[toString(),clone(), equals() & hashCode()] 
Should know the need for overriding equals() and hashCode().
